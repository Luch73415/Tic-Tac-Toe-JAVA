# Welcome to JAVA - TIC TAC TOE!

This is my first JAVA Application, I'm really happy to show it for you.
The game was designed to play againt the CPU (uses random to choose the position),  indicates the winner or CAT and It's not allowed to place pieces in the same position. 

## Technology used.
To built this game, I used **Java** with **IntelliJ** and the project was built in **Gradle** using the **Spring Initializr**.

## The mais file is [TicTacToeApplicationTests.java](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/blob/master/src/test/java/tictactoe/demo/TicTacToeApplicationTests.java "TicTacToeApplicationTests.java")

You can open it from [Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/tree/master)/[src](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/tree/master/src)/[test](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/tree/master/src/test)/[java](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/tree/master/src/test/java)/[tictactoe](https://github.com/Luch73415/Tic-Tac-Toe-JAVA/tree/master/src/test/java/tictactoe)/**demo**/
    
## Next Steps
For the next Steps I'm going to add some Machine Learning to the Computer and allow the battle add a PvP mode.
